README: Phrase Nets Analysis Backend

### Dependências Necessárias

To run the code, you must install the following Python packages:

FastAPI and Uvicorn are the web framework and server, respectively, that create the REST API. Install both with:
pip install fastapi uvicorn

python-multipart is mandatory for FastAPI to be able to process file uploads and form data (Form, File/UploadFile parameters):
pip install python-multipart

Stanza (Stanford NLP) is the robust NLP library used for "Syntactic Linking," providing syntactic dependency analysis, lemmatization, and POS-tagging in English.
Install it with: pip install stanza
**Attention:** After installation, execute the command to download the language model:
python -c "import stanza; stanza.download('en')"

NetworkX is essential for graph manipulation. It is used to build the initial network, apply "Filtering," and perform "Edge Compression":
pip install networkx

PyPDF2 is the tool used to extract text from PDF files:
pip install pypdf2

### 📁 File Structure and Functionality
The application is divided into three files to ensure modularity and clarity:

1.  main.py (API and Initialization): This is the application's entry point. It defines the FastAPI server and the main route "/analyze".
    It orchestrates the process: it receives the file upload or text snippet, validates the linking parameters (`linking_type` and `pattern`), handles input exceptions, and
    calls the main analysis function. It also contains the logic to start the Uvicorn server on port 8000.

2.  phrase_net_core.py (Core Logic): This is the "brain" of the analysis. It implements the three phases of the project:
    1. Linking where it offers the choice between "_orthographic_linking" or "`_syntactic_linking" (which uses Stanza for syntactic analysis);
    2. Network Filtering, which reduces the graph to the most relevant nodes; and
    3. Edge Compression, which simplifies the visualization by grouping topologically equivalent nodes.

3.  utils.py (Utilities): This module assists with data input and output. Its main function, "`extract_text_from_source", reads input data streams,
    whether from a ".txt" file or by performing the conversion of the content of a ".pdf" file to raw text, making it usable by the "phrase_net_core.py" module.
